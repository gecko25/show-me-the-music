## Today I Learned

I use this project as a space to learn and explore new toys. This is a summary of what I did and have learned

Prettify and Eslint

Personal Access Tokens in Git

Cypress CI

Setting up Environment Variables for Github Actions
I wanted to use continous integration for cypress tests, but ran into difficulties bc I couldnt use my secret api key.
